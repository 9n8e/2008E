# 2008E
A partial decompilation of the 2008 February client for the purpose of grasping the concepts behind commonly used functions.
Everything that you see here was decompiled by me with the use of x64dbg, IDA Pro, 2008E RBXGS symbols, and the 2016 source.
Also credit to all the people who have helped me along the way to understand these concepts a bit better, you know who you are.
